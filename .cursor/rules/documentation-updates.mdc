# Documentation Update Requirements

When working with or referencing design documentation files, you MUST update them if:

1. **API endpoints change** → Update relevant design doc
2. **Database schema changes** → Update `database_crud_design.md`
3. **New AI agent tools added** → Update `ai_agent_design.md`
4. **Simulation metrics change** → Update `simulation_design.md`
5. **Frontend components change** → Update `frontend_design.md`
6. **Data import process changes** → Update `data_retrieval_design.md`
7. **System architecture changes** → Update `architecture_overview.md`

## Update Guidelines

- Keep updates concise and focused on what changed
- Update relevant sections (endpoints, schemas, examples, etc.)
- Maintain consistent formatting with existing documentation
- Update code examples if they're affected by changes

## Existing Documentation Files (DO NOT CREATE NEW ONES)

- `docs/architecture_overview.md` - System design overview
- `docs/frontend_design.md` - React frontend specifications
- `docs/ai_agent_design.md` - AI agent tools and workflows
- `docs/simulation_design.md` - Simulation engine design
- `docs/database_crud_design.md` - ChromaDB and CRUD services
- `docs/data_retrieval_design.md` - ArkhamDB data import utility

**IMPORTANT**: Do not create additional documentation files unless explicitly instructed.
