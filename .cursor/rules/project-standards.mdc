# Arkham Assistant Project Standards

## Code Quality

- Major functionality MUST have basic tests covering core behavior
- Tests should be placed in appropriate test directories matching the source structure
- Prefer utility functions in dedicated modules over inline implementations
- Extract and generalize repeated logic into reusable utility functions

## Documentation

- **CRITICAL**: When modifying functionality, update relevant design documents in `/docs`:
  - `frontend_design.md` - for React components, UI, API integration
  - `ai_agent_design.md` - for AI agent tools, prompts, conversation flows
  - `simulation_design.md` - for simulation engine, metrics, algorithms
  - `database_crud_design.md` - for ChromaDB schema, CRUD operations, data models
  - `data_retrieval_design.md` - for ArkhamDB API integration, data import
  - `architecture_overview.md` - for system-wide architectural changes

- **DO NOT** create new markdown or documentation files unless explicitly instructed
- Keep documentation updates concise and focused on material changes
- Update inline code comments for complex logic

## Code Organization

- Keep functions focused and single-purpose
- Use clear, descriptive names for functions and variables
- Organize code into logical modules and packages
- Avoid deep nesting - extract complex logic into helper functions
