# Arkham Horror LCG - Comprehensive Rules Reference

*Source: Unofficial Compiled Rules (November 2025)*

*Extracted from community-compiled rules document*


## Game Overview


Arkham Horror: The Card Game is a cooperative Living Card Game (LCG) in which
one to four investigators work together to unravel arcane mysteries and conspiracies,
while simultaneously overcoming the personal demons that haunt their past.

Each player takes on the role of a single investigator and builds a deck around that
investigator's abilities. A series of interrelated scenarios creates a narrative campaign
through which a broader mystery is unraveled. In each scenario, investigators move through
and explore locations, look for clues that enable them to advance the story, and attempt
to evade or defeat the treacherous forces of the Mythos.


## Golden Rules


### The Golden Rule
If the text of this Rules Reference directly contradicts the text of the Learn to Play book,
the text of the Rules Reference takes precedence. If the text of a card directly contradicts
the text of either the Rules Reference or the Learn to Play book, the text of the card takes
precedence.

### The Silver Rule
If the text of two cards directly contradict one another in a way that is impossible to
reconcile, the encounter card takes precedence over the player card. If both cards are
encounter cards or both are player cards, the lead investigator may decide which takes
precedence.

### The Grim Rule
If players are unable to find the answer to a rules or timing conflict in this Rules Reference,
resolve the conflict in the manner that the players perceive as the worst possible at that
moment with regards to winning the scenario, and continue with the game.

The Grim Rule only comes into effect if players are unable to find the answer to a rules or
timing conflict, and are thus unable to continue playing the game. It is designed to keep the
game moving when looking up the correct answer would be too time-consuming. The Grim Rule
is not an exhaustive answer to rules/timing conflicts.

When investigators are forced to make a choice and there are multiple valid options, the lead
investigator decides between those options. The Grim Rule does not play a part in these choices.


## Game Structure and Phases


### Phases of Play
Each game round consists of four phases in order:

1. **Mythos Phase** - The forces working against the investigators advance their agenda.
   Doom is placed on the current agenda, and investigators draw encounter cards.

2. **Investigation Phase** - Each investigator takes a turn, performing up to 3 actions.
   Investigators take turns in player order.

3. **Enemy Phase** - Hunter enemies move toward investigators. Engaged enemies attack
   the investigators they're engaged with.

4. **Upkeep Phase** - All exhausted cards ready. Each investigator draws 1 card and
   gains 1 resource. Discard down to hand size if needed.

### Actions
Each investigator gets 3 actions per turn during the Investigation Phase. Basic actions:

- **Investigate** - Test intellect against location's shroud to discover clues
- **Move** - Move to a connecting location
- **Fight** - Test combat against enemy's fight value to deal damage
- **Evade** - Test agility against enemy's evade value to exhaust and disengage
- **Draw** - Draw 1 card from your investigator deck
- **Resource** - Gain 1 resource
- **Play** - Play an asset or event card from your hand (pay its cost)
- **Activate** - Use an action ability (marked with the action arrow icon)

### Attacks of Opportunity
If an investigator is engaged with one or more ready enemies, performing any action other
than Fight, Evade, or an ability with a Parley or Resign designator causes each of those
enemies to attack. This is called an attack of opportunity.


## Clues and Doom


### Clues
Clues represent the progress investigators make towards solving a mystery and advancing
the scenario.

- When locations are revealed, clues equal to the location's clue value (per investigator
  symbol H multiplies by number of investigators) are placed on them
- Clues are discovered by successfully investigating (intellect test vs shroud) or card effects
- Discovered clues are placed on the investigator's card
- Investigators spend clues as a group to advance the act deck
- The act shows how many clues are needed to advance (bottom right of card)

### Doom
Doom represents the progress the forces of the Mythos make towards their goals.

- During each Mythos Phase, 1 doom is placed on the current agenda
- Doom on ANY card in play (enemies, locations, assets) counts toward the total
- When doom equals or exceeds the agenda's doom threshold, the agenda advances
- Most agenda advances are unfavorable for investigators
- Some card effects add or remove doom


## Skill Tests


### Skill Test Timing
When performing a skill test, follow these steps:

1. **ST.1** - Determine skill type of test (willpower, intellect, combat, or agility)
2. **ST.2** - Commit cards from hand to the skill test (each card can only be committed
   to tests by its owner, and only if it has at least one matching skill icon)
3. **ST.3** - Reveal chaos token from the chaos bag
4. **ST.4** - Apply chaos token effect (modifier and/or special effect)
5. **ST.5** - Determine investigator's modified skill value (base + icons + modifiers)
6. **ST.6** - Determine success/failure (modified skill value >= difficulty = success)
7. **ST.7** - Apply skill test results (success or failure effects)
8. **ST.8** - Skill test ends, discard all committed cards

### Committing Cards
- Only the investigator performing the test and investigators at the same location may
  commit cards
- Each card committed must have at least one icon matching the skill being tested
- Wild icons (?) can be committed to any test
- Each investigator may commit only 1 card to each skill test (unless card effects allow more)

### Difficulty
The difficulty of a skill test is the target number the investigator must match or exceed.
- For investigate actions: the location's shroud value
- For fight actions: the enemy's fight value
- For evade actions: the enemy's evade value
- Other tests: specified by the card or ability

### Automatic Success and Failure
- The Elder Sign token typically grants automatic success or a bonus
- The Auto-fail (tentacle) token always results in failure, regardless of skill value
- Some card effects grant automatic success or failure


## Enemies and Combat


### Enemy Engagement
- When an enemy spawns at an investigator's location or an investigator enters a location
  with a ready, unengaged enemy, engagement occurs
- Engaged enemies are placed in the investigator's threat area
- Aloof enemies do not automatically engage; they must be engaged using the Engage action
- Massive enemies are considered engaged with all investigators at their location

### Fight Action
1. Choose an enemy at your location to attack
2. Perform a combat test against the enemy's fight value
3. If successful, deal damage to the enemy (usually 1, but weapons may deal more)
4. If the enemy has damage equal to or greater than its health, it is defeated
5. If you fail while attacking an enemy engaged with another investigator, that
   investigator takes the damage instead

### Evade Action
1. Choose an enemy you are engaged with
2. Perform an agility test against the enemy's evade value
3. If successful, the enemy exhausts and disengages (moves to your location, no longer
   in threat area)
4. Exhausted enemies don't attack during the enemy phase

### Enemy Keywords
- **Hunter** - During enemy phase, moves toward nearest investigator
- **Retaliate** - When you fail a fight test, it attacks you
- **Alert** - When you fail an evade test, it attacks you
- **Aloof** - Does not engage automatically; must use Engage action
- **Massive** - Engaged with all investigators at its location
- **Elusive** - After evading, moves to a connecting location instead of staying


## Deckbuilding


### Basic Deckbuilding Rules
- Minimum 30 cards (not counting investigator signature cards)
- Maximum 2 copies of any card by title (not by level)
- Must follow investigator's deckbuilding restrictions (class access, level limits)
- Must include required signature cards and signature weakness

### Card Levels and Experience
- Card level is shown by pips in the upper left corner (0-5)
- Level 0 cards are included during initial deck construction
- Higher level cards are purchased during campaign play using experience points (XP)
- Upgrading a card: pay the difference in XP between levels (minimum 1)
- Purchasing a new card: pay XP equal to card's level (minimum 1)

### Classes

- **Seeker** - Investigation, card draw, knowledge
- **Rogue** - Resources, evasion, risk/reward
- **Mystic** - Willpower-based abilities, spells
- **Survivor** - Resilience, recursion, failure benefits

### Multi-Class Cards
Some cards belong to multiple classes (gold-bordered). A multi-class card:
- Can be included if you have access to ANY of its classes
- Counts against limited class slots based on deckbuilding options wording
- Is considered a card of each of its classes for all game purposes


## Keywords Reference

the scenario, and continue with the game.
Constant abilities have no point of initiation.
When investigators are forced to make a choice and there are multiple
valid options, the lead investigator decides between those options. The
Grim Rule does not play a part in these choices.
For example: Locked Door reads "Attach to the location with the most clues,
and without a Locked Door attached." If there are 3 locations that are tied
for the most clues, and none of them already have a Locked Door attached,
the lead investigator decides between those 3 locations. Players are not forced
to decide which of those 3 options would be the objectively worst option.

#### Activate Action

"Activate" is an action an investigator may take during his or her turn in
the investigation phase.
When this action is taken, the investigator initiates an ability that
specifies one or more I icons as part of its ability cost. The number
of I icons in the ability's cost determines how many actions the
investigator is required to use for this activate action. When performing
an activate action, all of that action's costs are simultaneously paid.
Then, the consequences of that action resolve.
An investigator is permitted to activate abilities from the following
sources:
= A card in play and under his or her control. This includes his or
her investigator card.
= A scenario card that is in play and at the same location as the
investigator. This includes the location itself, encounter cards
placed at that location, and all encounter cards in the threat area
of any investigator at that location.
= The current act or current agenda card.

#### Active Player

The active player is the player taking his or her turn during the
investigation phase.

#### Alert

Some enemies have the alert keyword. Each time an investigator fails
a skill test while attempting to evade an enemy with the alert keyword,
after applying all results for that skill test, that enemy performs an
attack against the evading investigator. An enemy does not exhaust after
performing an alert attack. This attack occurs whether the enemy is
engaged with the evading investigator or not. This attack occurs even if
the evading investigator is not at the enemy's location.

enemy (exhausting it and breaking its engagement).

value of 5. (If you discarded Hope, this test is automatically successful.)" If
Patrice chooses to discard Hope, the skill test automatically succeeds before
chaos tokens are revealed; therefore Steps 3 and 4 of the skill test are skipped.
However, the skill test still takes place. Cards may still be committed to the
test, and the investigator's total modified skill value is still determined, as it
may have some bearing on other card abilities. However, if Patrice instead

#### Base Value

Base value is the value of an element before any modifiers are applied.
Unless otherwise specified, the base value of an element derived from a
card is the value printed on that card.

#### Bearer

The bearer of a weakness is the investigator who started the game with
the weakness in his or her deck or play area.

resolved chaos tokens should be applied, even though the rules state
"the revealed chaos token." Similarly, any card effects that refer to "the
revealed chaos token" refer to all of the resolved tokens.
For example: An investigator plays Premonition, which reads: "Put
Premonition into play, reveal a random chaos token from the chaos bag,
and seal it on Premonition." That investigator then uses Olive McBride to
"reveal 3 chaos tokens instead of 1, choose 2 of those tokens to resolve, and
ignore the other." In this case, both of the resolved tokens would be sealed on
Premonition, even though Premonition only refers to the revealed token as
a singular token. Likewise, when Premonition instructs that investigator to
"Resolve the token sealed here as if it were just revealed from the chaos bag,"
the investigator should resolve both of the tokens sealed on it.

#### Collection

If an ability refers to a player's collection (for example, "search the

assembled is used.
Example: Sean and Etienne are each using a deck built from Sean's
collection. If Etienne is instructed to "search the collection," he searches Sean's
collection.

For example: There is a Coterie Agent and a Coterie Assassin in the
shadows. There is a concealed mini-card at Kymani's location and another
concealed mini-card at a connecting location. (1) First, Kymani plays an
event that discovers a clue at their location, but instead of discovering a clue,
they choose to expose the concealed mini-card at their location, flipping it
over. That mini-card is a decoy, and is set aside without effect. (2) Next,
they move to the connecting location with the other concealed mini-card
and attempt to expose it using an evade action. They succeed and flip the
mini-card over…revealing the Coterie Assassin's mini-card! (3) The Coterie
Assassin's mini-card is set aside, and the Coterie Assassin in the shadows is
moved to Kymani's location, engaging them. Because there is another enemy
in the shadows, they do not remove any of the other concealed mini-cards
from play.

multiple effects, such as Power Word with its Tonguetwister or Thrice Spoken
commands, or Breaking and Entering?
An ability that contains multiple effects able to expose an enemy can
have just one of those effects replaced with the exposure. A concealed
mini-card may be exposed by successfully attacking it, successfully/
automatically evading it, successfully investigating its location,
automatically dealing damage to it, or automatically discovering
a clue at its location. Any of these effects can be replaced with the
exposing of one mini-card, and only one mini-card at a time can be
exposed by such an effect. For example, Breaking and Entering has
two effects: investigating and, if successful, automatically evading
an enemy. Either of these effects may be replaced with exposing a
concealed mini-card, but not both. Likewise, if you issue the Betray
and Confess commands via Power Word's Tonguetwister upgrade,
only the damage or the clue discovery may be replaced with an
exposure; the other effect is resolved as normal. This holds true even
if issuing two commands to 3 enemies via Thrice Spoken: only 1
single concealed mini-card may be exposed even when resolving the
effect for 3 different enemies.

#### Elusive

Elusive is a keyword ability that appears on some enemies in this
expansion. Elusive enemies represent enemies who want to avoid the
investigators for their own survival or to accomplish their own goals.
If a ready enemy with the elusive keyword attacks or is attacked, after
that attack resolves, that enemy immediately disengages from all
investigators, moves to a connecting location (with no investigators, if
able), and exhausts.

#### Warring

Warring is a keyword ability that causes the warring factions to move
toward and attack one another during the enemy phase.
During the "hunter enemies move" step of the enemy phase, each ready,
unengaged enemy with the warring keyword moves once toward the
nearest warring enemy of a different faction.
Æ Warring enemies move in faction order.

belonging to a different faction do not move. During the "resolve enemy attacks" step of the enemy phase, each of these
enemies attacks a warring enemy of a different faction. First the Zealot of

movement, the enemy does not move. 1 doom to be placed on the blue agenda.
Æ If a warring enemy would be compelled to move to a location
where the move is blocked by a card ability, the enemy does not
move.
During the "resolve enemy attacks" step of the enemy phase, each
unengaged enemy with the warring keyword attacks a warring enemy at
its location of a different faction.
Æ Warring enemies attack in faction order.
Æ If there are multiple enemies who qualify as a target for this
attack, the warring enemy attacks the enemy (of a different
faction) with the least remaining health. If there is a tie, the lead
investigator may choose the target of the attack.
Æ An attack made in this way deals damage equal to the attacking
enemy's combined damage and horror values.
Æ If an enemy attacks and defeats another enemy (other than
a swarm card), place 1 doom on the agenda matching the
attacking enemy's faction.
Warring Example:
A Disciple of the Swarm is in Streets of New York City, a Hune-Stitched
Herald is in Arkham, and a Zealot of Paradise is in Streets of Montréal.
Each of them has the warring keyword, and each is ready and unengaged.
During the "hunter enemies move" step of the enemy phase, each of these
enemies moves once toward the nearest warring enemy of a different faction.
In this case, the green enemy moves first, to Arkham. The Hune-Stitched
Herald does not move, since there is already an enemy at its location. Finally,
the Disciple of the Swarm moves to Arkham, as well.

As with other slots, tarot slots limit the number of asset cards of that
slot type an investigator is permitted to have in play simultaneously. All
other rules governing slots apply to tarot slots, as usual.
By default, an investigator has only one tarot slot available.

#### Shifting Slots z

Some card effects allow an investigator to put assets of one slot type
into one of their other slots, allow one of an investigator's slot types
to carry assets of a different slot type, or cause assets to no longer take
up slots. In such an event, the investigator must decide which slot is
holding which asset at the moment it is played. This cannot be adjusted
later unless the contents or quantity of the investigator's slots changes,
at which point the investigator may switch which slots are holding any
of their assets.
For example: Kōhaku has Occult Reliquary in play when he plays Blessed
Blade. He chooses to have Occult Reliquary grant him a hand slot to hold
Blessed Blade. If he later plays another Blessed card, such as Hallowed
Mirror, he can choose to have the new card take up the additional slot and
define the slot type, while he moves Blessed Blade to his default hand slot.

#### Uses (X "type") Victory Display, Victory Points

Uses is a keyword ability. Some encounter cards are worth victory points. The text Victory X
indicates that a card is worth X victory points.
When a card bearing this keyword enters play, place a number of
resource tokens equal to the value (X), from the token pool, on the
card. The word following the value establishes and identifies the type
of uses this card bears. The resource tokens placed on the card are
considered uses of the established type, and are not considered resource
tokens.

references the type of use established by the keyword as a part of

The value of the letter X is defined by a card ability or a granted player
choice. If X is not defined, its value is equal to 0.

The following guidelines are used to interpret which investigator is

= A Revelation ability that references "you" or "your" refers to the
investigator who drew the card and is resolving the ability.
= When resolving a triggered ability ( U , Y, or I ability),
"you/your" refers to the investigator triggering the ability.
= If an ability contains a clause identifying whom it is targeting,
"you/your" in that ability refers to those investigators. For
example, Stubborn Detective reads: "While Stubborn Detective is
at your location..." This clause identifies "you" as any investigator at
his location. Young Deep One reads: "After Young Deep One engages
you..." This clause identifies "you" as any investigator who engages
Young Deep One.
= Any other instance of "you/your" that does not fall into the
above categories refers to the investigator who controls the card,
the investigator who has the card in his/her threat area, or who
is currently interacting with the card.
A card may have multiple different abilities in which "you/your" may be
interpreted differently. "You/your" may refer to a different investigator
in each of these abilities.
For example: Dreams of R'lyeh reads:
"Revelation - Put Dreams of R'lyeh into play in your threat area.You get -1

#### A A

and -1 sanity.I: Test (3). If you succeed, Discard Dreams of R'lyeh."
These three abilities reference "you/your" in different ways. For the
Revelation ability, "your" refers to the investigator who drew Dreams
of R'lyeh and is resolving its Revelation. For its constant ability, "you"
refers to the investigator who has Dreams of R'lyeh in his or her threat
area. For its I ability, "you" refers to the investigator who is performing
the I ability.
Interpreting "You" When Taking or Being Dealt Damage
When an ability refers to "you" in response to taking damage or being
dealt damage, it also includes any assets you control.
For example: The Y ability on Survival Knife triggers "after an enemy
attack deals damage to you during the enemy phase." This ability triggers
even if the damage from that attack is assigned to one or more of your assets,
and not your investigator card. However, if all of the damage from that
attack is assigned to another investigator or their assets (through the use of a
card effect that allows them to do so), then no damage has been dealt to you.
